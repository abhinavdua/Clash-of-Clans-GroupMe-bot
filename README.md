# GroupMe NodeJS Callback Bot for Clash of Clans

## Introduction

This bot was intended to be used in a GroupMe chat for my clan - Reddit Templars - in the popular mobile game [Clash of Clans](http://supercell.com/en/games/clashofclans/). This is a fork of [batorobe's bot](https://github.com/batorobe/bot-tutorial-nodejs-rMA32), which was forked from https://github.com/groupme/bot-tutorial-nodejs.

I have modified it specifically for our clan, but includes some useful features that anyone could use. Unlike the code that this bot was forked from, it cannot be run on Heroku at this time. It stores data to a .json file which doesn't work with Heroku by default as you must you a third party.

I will include instructions to set this up on a server in the future.
